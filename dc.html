<title> FOR MY POOKIE </title>
<body>

<h1> POOKIE, IT'S FOR YOU </h1>

<h2> A twinkle in your eye, a smile so bright,
You fill my days with warmth and light.
Your laughter rings, a joyous sound,
In you, my happiness is found </h2>

<p> Being with you feels like stepping into the perfect happily ever after, like the grand finale of a beloved Jane Austen novel. But there's also an unexpected thrill, like the heart-pounding twists in a Dan Brown mystery. You keep me guessing in the best way possible, and I can't wait to see what adventures the next chapter holds for us </p>

<h3> I LOAF YOU </h3>
